# Task Manager | TypeScrip

**Description:**
This is a simple Task Manager web application written in TypeScript. It allows users to add tasks with timestamps and displays them along with the total time spent on tasks. The design includes a clean interface with an input field, a button for adding tasks, a task list, and the total time spent.

**Features:**
1. **Add Task:** Users can add tasks with timestamps by entering task descriptions in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
2. **Timestamps:** Each task includes a timestamp indicating when it was added.
3. **Task List:** The added tasks are displayed in a list format, showing the task description and timestamp.
4. **Total Time:** The application calculates and displays the total time spent on tasks.

**Installation:**
Follow these steps to set up the Task Manager web application:

1. Download the HTML, TypeScript (`app.ts`), CSS (`styles.css`), and TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) files.
2. Install TypeScript globally using the following command: `npm install -g typescript`.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory and run the command: `tsc` to compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript.
4. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the Task Manager application.

Ensure that the favicon files (`favicon.ico` and `favicon.png`) are present in the project directory or adjust the paths accordingly. You can customize the design and functionality to suit your preferences by modifying the TypeScript, HTML, and CSS code.
